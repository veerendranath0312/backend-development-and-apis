# Exercise Tracker

This is my solution to the Exercise Tracker project from freeCodeCamp. Instructions for building the project can be found at [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/apis-and-microservices/apis-and-microservices-projects/exercise-tracker)

## Start the application locally

To start the application:

```bash
# Install dependancies
$ npm install

# create a .env file and put there the MONGODB_URI for connecting to your mongodb database
$ echo "MONGODB_URI=<YOUR-MONGODB-URI>" > .env

# Start the application
$ npm run dev
```
